                                    <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far.
                                        Nobody's ever been
                                        more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot
                                        isn't successful
                                        like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry
                                        losers and haters, but
                                        my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid
                                        or insecure, it's not

                            <p>2017<br>
                                Became 45th president of the United States</p>
                            <p>2016<br>
                                Won election race with 77 votes more than Clinton, yippe-kee-yay!</p>
                            <p>2015<br>
                                Became the most important Republican nominating for presidential election run</p>
                            <p>2009<br>
                                Changed my mind and became Republican again</p>
                            <p>2005<br>
                                Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades,
                                certificates and other
                                bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management
                                entrepreneurship, and wealth
                                creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                                ungrateful gringos
                                filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to
                                settle that...
                            </p>
                            <p>2002<br>
                                Acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the
                                Trump Park
                                Avenue. I sure do like my surname!</p>
                            <p>2001<br>
                                Completed Trump World Tower and joined the Democratic Party</p>
                            <p>1999<br>
                                Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have 18 of them now in USA and
                                abroad! Also
                                switched to the Reform Party that year</p>
                            <p>1997<br>
                                Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River, which was named Trump Place.
                                Me and the
                                other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the biggest
                                residential sale in the
                                history of New York City</p>
                            <p>1996<br>
                                Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story
                                skyscraper on Wall
                                Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building</p>
                            <p>1994<br>
                                Refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle, turned it into a 44-story
                                luxury
                                property known as Trump International Hotel and Tower</p>
                            <p>1989 ― 1992<br>
                                Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a waste of money, I had to sell it,
                                now it is
                                American Airlines Shuttle, btw</p>
                            <p>1989, 1990<br>
                                Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my very own Tour de Trump. Is America
                                not great
                                enough for that cycling competition?</p>
                            <p>1988<br>
                                Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million, invested $50 million to restore
                                the building
                                and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold
                                it for a lot
                                of cash in 1995)</p>
                            <p>1987<br>
                                Registered as a Republican</p>
                            <p>1985<br>
                                I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can
                                join if you pay
                                $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive
                                to be rich).
                                That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager,
                                because she is
                                another Trump!</p>
                            <p>1983<br>
                                I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play
                                schedule and filed
                                an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good
                                now, but back
                                then they were great!</p>
                            <p>1980<br>
                                Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of
                                undocumented Polish
                                workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All
                                this to make
                                architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most
                                pleasant
                                interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I
